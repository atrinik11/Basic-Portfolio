                     readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum
                     is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 
                     'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop 
                     publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model 
                     text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. 
                     Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose 
                    (injected humour and the like).<br>
                    1914 translation by H. Rackham
                      "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising
                    pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual
                    teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No
                    one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because
                    those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
                    extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain
                    of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and
                    pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever 
                    undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has
                    any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, 
                    or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
